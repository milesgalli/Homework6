# Homework 6

This assignment required the use of 3 open weather API's. Those being the UV index API, 5day weather forcast API, and the current weather data.
The user can search for a city and the app will shows the current weather forcast, and the 5 day forcast. The search result will be saved and stored in local storage. If the user then clicks eithr of these past search results, the weather data will show. 

This app included the use of;
- API's 
- HTML
- CSS 
- Jquery 
- local storage 
- AJAX 

# Additional Comments 
I found this assingment a little tricky as the html layout was a challenge. As well as getting the past search items click listeners to change the weather data when the user clicked on them. My ability to solve these unique problems is getting better but is slow progress. I am looking forward to building the project as it requires some higher level thinking.
